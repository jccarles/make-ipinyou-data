make-ipinyou-data
=================

This project is forked from [make-ipinyou-data](https://github.com/wnzhang/make-ipinyou-data), slightly changing the data format for future use.

### Step 0
Go to [data.computational-advertising.org](http://data.computational-advertising.org) to download `ipinyou.contest.dataset.zip`. Unzip it and get the folder `ipinyou.contest.dataset`.

### Step 1
Update the soft link for the folder `ipinyou.contest.dataset` in `original-data`. 
```
XXX/make-ipinyou-data/original-data$ ln -sfn ~/Data/ipinyou.contest.dataset ipinyou.contest.dataset
```
Under `make-ipinyou-data/original-data/ipinyou.contest.dataset` there should be the original dataset files like this:
```
weinan@ZHANG:~/Project/make-ipinyou-data/original-data/ipinyou.contest.dataset$ ls
algo.submission.demo.tar.bz2  README         testing2nd   training3rd
city.cn.txt                   region.cn.txt  testing3rd   user.profile.tags.cn.txt
city.en.txt                   region.en.txt  training1st  user.profile.tags.en.txt
files.md5                     testing1st     training2nd
```
You do not need to further unzip the packages in the subfolders.

### Step 2
Under `make-ipinyou-data` folder, just run `make all`.

After the program finished, the total size of the folder will be 14G. The files under `make-ipinyou-data` should be like this:
```
XXX/make-ipinyou-data$ ls
1458  2261  2997  3386  3476  LICENSE   mkyzxdata.sh   python     schema.txt
2259  2821  3358  3427  all   Makefile  original-data  README.md
```
Normally, we only do experiment for each campaign (e.g. `1458`). `all` is just the merge of all the campaigns. You can delete `all` if you think it is unuseful in your experiment.

### Use of the data
We use campaign 1458 as example here.
```
XXX/make-ipinyou-data/1458$ ls
featindex.txt  test.log.txt  test.yzx.txt  train.log.txt  train.yzx.txt
```
* `train.log.txt` and `test.log.txt` are the formalised string data for each row (record) in train and test. The first column is whether the user click the ad or not.
* `featindex.txt`maps the features to their indexes. For example, `8:1.1.174.*	76` means that the 8th column in `train.log.txt` with the string `1.1.174.*` maps to feature index `76`.
* `train.yzx.txt` and `test.yzx.txt` are the mapped vector data for `train.log.txt` and `test.log.txt`. The format is y:click, and x:features. Such data is in the standard form as introduced in [iPinYou Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7073).
